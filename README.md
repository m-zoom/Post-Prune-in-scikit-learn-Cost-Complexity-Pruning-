# 🌡️ Temperature Classifier with Decision Tree Pruning

This project demonstrates how to build and prune a **Decision Tree Classifier** using `scikit-learn`. The model predicts whether the temperature is **Cold**, **Warm**, or **Hot** based on **temperature** and **humidity** input.

## 🧠 What It Does

- Classifies weather into three categories: `Cold`, `Warm`, `Hot`
- Uses realistic temperature and humidity data
- Applies **cost-complexity pruning** to prevent overfitting
- Evaluates accuracy vs. pruning level
- Visualizes the best pruned decision tree
